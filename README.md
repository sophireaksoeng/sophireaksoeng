# Hello, I'm Sophireak 🔴🛡️

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a developer with a strong focus on cybersecurity and Red Team operations. My work revolves around building secure, efficient, and scalable software, with an emphasis on offensive security practices. I'm passionate about exploring vulnerabilities, simulating attacks, and working on solutions that strengthen systems against cyber threats. When I'm not coding, I'm diving deep into cybersecurity research, tackling real-world challenges, and contributing to open-source projects to help others in the field.

## 🚀 Technologies & Tools:
- **Languages**: JavaScript (React.js, Node.js), Java, Python, Bash
- **Databases**: MySQL, MongoDB
- **Tools**: Git, Docker, Kubernetes
- **Security**: RSA, AES encryption, Metasploit, Nmap, Gobuster, Burp Suite , Hydra
- **Offensive Security**: Reconnaissance, Exploitation, Post-Exploitation, Reporting
- **Framework**: Empire (for post-exploitation)
- **Reporting**: Markdown, LaTeX

## 🌱 Currently Learning:
- **Web** & **Mobile DevOps**
- **Cybersecurity** (Red Team Focus)
- **Cloud Security** (Cloud Pen Testing)

## Projects I'm Working On:
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Implementing RSA and AES encryption to secure file uploads and downloads.
- **Reconnaissance**: Developing tools to scan for open ports, vulnerable services, and subdomains.
- **Exploitation**: Building simulations of network exploitation and attacks (SQL Injection, XSS).
- **Post-Exploitation**: Automating lateral movement and data exfiltration in compromised networks.
- **Reporting**: Generating detailed reports on vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and exploited weaknesses.


## Fun Fact:
- I have a deep passion for **Cybersecurity** and **Cars**—both require precision, attention to detail, and a love for pushing limits.
